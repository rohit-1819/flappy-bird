In flappybird.c --

#define JUMP_VELOCITY -2.5f	--> Preprocessor directive that sets a constant for the upward speed when the bird jumps. We use a negative number because in terminal coordinates, Y increases as you go down.

#define GRAVITY 0.2f  -->   Defines the constant acceleration pulling the bird down each frame.

#define PIPE_GAP_HEIGHT 8	-->     Defines the vertical size (in characters/rows) of the opening the bird must fly through.

#define FRAME_DELAY_US 50000	-->     Defines the pause duration for each frame in microseconds (50,000 Î¼s=50ms). This determines the game's speed (20 frames per second).
